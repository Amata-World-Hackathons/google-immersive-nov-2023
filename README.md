# Introduction

This is the open-source repository for the submission to Google’s Immersive
Geospatial Challenge 2023. Find the original post [here](https://devpost.com/software/gemtrails).

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
* Unity 2020.3 or later
* An API token from Google Cloud – requires access to the Directions API,
  ARCore APIs and mapping on Android/iOS
* `protoc` (optional) - only required if you intend to regenerate the protobuf
  files. The original protobuf was generated in a different project (which was
  already setup with `protoc`)

Please also note the assets have been redacted from the repo to respect the
rules on the Unity asset store.
